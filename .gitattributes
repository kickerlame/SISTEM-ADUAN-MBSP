# ============================================================================
# AUDIT REPORT
# ============================================================================
#
# 1. CRITICAL ISSUES (Must Fix)
#    - Line 3: Redundant attributes "text text=auto" - should be "* text=auto"
#      The word "text" appears twice which is syntactically incorrect.
#
# 2. MEDIUM ISSUES (Should Fix)
#    - Missing binary declarations for common CakePHP/web assets:
#      * *.svg (can be text but often treated as binary to prevent corruption)
#      * *.mp3, *.wav, *.ogg (audio files)
#      * *.doc, *.docx (Office documents)
#      * *.sqlite, *.db (database files used in testing per ci.yml)
#    - Missing *.pem text declaration should include "text" attribute for clarity
#    - No export-ignore rules for CI/dev files (.github/, tests/, phpcs.xml, etc.)
#      that shouldn't be in production distributions
#
# 3. MINOR ISSUES (Nice to Improve)
#    - Missing diff attribute for PHP files: "*.php diff=php"
#    - Missing linguist attributes for accurate GitHub language detection
#    - No explicit handling for *.css, *.js, *.json, *.xml, *.yml files
#    - Consider adding *.lock files handling (composer.lock)
#    - Missing *.bmp binary declaration
#    - No *.twig or *.php template specific rules
#
# 4. OVERALL RISK LEVEL: MEDIUM
#    - The critical syntax error on line 3 may cause unexpected behavior
#    - Missing binary types could lead to file corruption on cross-platform teams
#    - No security risks identified
#    - Functional for basic use but incomplete for production CakePHP 5 project
